## Peer Influence
Literature indicates that the influence of peers and user engagement can affect a user's decision to pay for a premium subscription. 
Using the given data of another freemium service platform, we try to predict the decision whether the user purchases using these two types of variables. 
These results can help quantify the effect of social engagement on the revenues, as well as stipulate how valuable a premium subscriber could be in a freemium social community.
