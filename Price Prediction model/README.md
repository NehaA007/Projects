## Price Prediction Model of Used Cars
Given the recent volatility in the prices of used cars throughout 2021, it was relevant to investigate what factors typically drive these price variations. An effective way of accomplishing this goal is to generate a variety of robust models that take a several attributes into account. While the use for an effective model could be extensive, it was most pertinent within the used-car dealerships. Using our group’s generated models will allow dealerships to get a better understanding of an acceptable list price given a number of factors. The dataset used herein consists of all up-to-date vehicle listings from a famous retailer of used cars in the US. It introduces relevant information of the listed used cars, such as their prices, manufacturer, latitude/longitude of listing, paint color, etc. More importantly, the goal is to predict the used car prices based on the 14 attributes, such as “manufacturer”, “condition”, “cylinder”, “fuel”, etc. Herein, the focus is on developing an effective price prediction model, while also answering the question of the area (or state) where used cars are priced higher on an average.
